# Goldfinch Overview

## Participants

{% hint style="success" %}
The Goldfinch protocol has four core participants: Borrowers, Backers, Liquidity Providers, and Auditors.
{% endhint %}

**Borrowers** are participants who seek financing, and they propose Borrower Pools for the Backers to assess. Borrower Pools contain the terms a Borrower seeks, like the interest rate and repayment schedule.

**Backers** assess the Borrower Pools and decide whether to supply first-loss capital. After Backers supply capital, Borrowers can borrow and repay through the Borrower Pool.

**Liquidity Providers** supply capital to the Senior Pool in order to earn passive yield. The Senior Pool uses the Leverage Model to automatically allocate capital to the Borrower Pools, based on how many Backers are participating in them. When the Senior Pool allocates capital, a portion of its interest is reallocated to the Backers. This increases the Backers’ effective yield, which incentives them to both provide the higher-risk first-loss capital and do the work of assessing Borrower Pools.

Lastly, **Auditors** vote to approve Borrowers, which is required before they can borrow. Auditors are randomly selected by the protocol, and they provide a human-level check to guard against fraudulent activity.

## Glossary of Core Components

> * **Auditors** — Participants who receive GFI rewards for securing the protocol with
>
>   a human eye.
>
> * **Backers** — Participants who supply junior tranche \(first-loss\) capital to
>
>   individual Borrower Pools.
>
> * **Borrowers** — Participants who raise capital from the protocol via Borrower
>
>   Pools.
>
> * **Borrower Pool** — Smart contract that encodes a set of financing terms for a
>
>   Borrower, including the interest rate and repayment schedule, and through
>
>   which the Borrower can borrow capital and repay it with those terms.
>
> * **GFI** — Token used for Governance votes, Auditor staking, Auditor vote rewards,
>
>   staking on Backers, early Backer rewards, and other potential rewards for all
>
>   protocol participants.
>
> * **Governance** — Smart contract that is managed by the community DAO and has
>
>   the ability to update the protocol via decentralized governance votes.
>
> * **Leverage Model** — A formula by which the Senior Pool automatically determines
>
>   how much capital to allocate to each Borrower Pool.
>
> * **Liquidity Providers** — Participants who supply capital to the Senior Pool.
> * **Senior Pool** — Smart contract that accepts capital from Liquidity Providers and
>
>   automatically allocates capital to the senior tranche of Borrower Pools according
>
>   to the Leverage Model.
