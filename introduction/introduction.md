?> Goldfinch is a decentralized protocol that allows for crypto borrowing without
crypto collateral.

A core limitation of current crypto lending protocols is that they require
overcollateralization with crypto, which prevents the vast majority of borrowers in the
world from participating. By incorporating the principle of `trust through consensus`,
the Goldfinch protocol creates a way for borrowers to show creditworthiness based on
the collective assessment of other participants rather than based on their crypto assets.
The protocol can then use this collective assessment as a signal for automatically
allocating capital. By removing the need for crypto collateral and providing a means for
passive yield, the protocol dramatically expands both the potential borrowers who can
access crypto and the potential capital providers who can gain exposure.
